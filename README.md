- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a stysheet language allowing us to style the HTML elements by defining colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing. CSS gives a more look, feel, and presentation to the layout of the webpage.

- CSS Grid. CSS grid divides a container into grid areas with rows and columns where the child elements are placed into these grid areas. An example would be the images portrayed in the app.

  - All images were compressed and sized accordingly & properly to fit the perfect view in different screen resolutions, while still witholding it's quality, with the help of Figma.
